# Bitcoin UTXO Burner

A Node.js tool for permanently burning Bitcoin by sending UTXOs to OP_RETURN outputs.

## Overview

This utility allows users to permanently remove Bitcoin from circulation by creating transactions that send the entire value of a UTXO (minus network fees) to an OP_RETURN output. This effectively makes the Bitcoin unspendable, "burning" it permanently.

## Warning

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Burning Bitcoin is irreversible. Once a transaction is confirmed, the funds cannot be recovered. This tool should only be used by users who fully understand the implications and have verified the code thoroughly.

## Features

- Burn an entire UTXO to an OP_RETURN output
- Customize the burn message
- Automatically calculates and deducts network fees
- Produces raw transaction hex that can be broadcast through various services
- Pure JavaScript implementation for easy testing with no external dependencies

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jrobinfo/Bitcoin_UTXO_Burner.git
cd Bitcoin_UTXO_Burner

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Testing with Pure JavaScript

This tool includes a pure JavaScript implementation for testing the Bitcoin burning process without requiring any external Bitcoin infrastructure:

```bash
# Run the JavaScript regtest implementation
npm test
```

This simulates:
1. Creating Bitcoin addresses
2. Funding a test wallet
3. Creating a burn transaction with an OP_RETURN output
4. Broadcasting the transaction to a simulated network
5. Confirming and verifying the transaction

## Usage in Your Application

To use this tool in your own application:

```javascript
const { burnBitcoin } = require('./bitcoin-utxo-burner');

// Parameters:
// 1. Private key in WIF format
// 2. Transaction ID of the UTXO to burn
// 3. Output index of the UTXO to burn
// 4. Fee rate in satoshis per byte
burnBitcoin('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_WIF', 'TX_ID', 0, 2)
  .then(txHex => {
    console.log('Transaction created successfully');
    console.log('Raw transaction hex:', txHex);
    // Broadcast the transaction using a service like Blockstream.info
  })
  .catch(err => console.error('Burn failed:', err));
```

## Broadcasting the Transaction

After generating the transaction hex, you can broadcast it using:

1. A Bitcoin node with the `sendrawtransaction` RPC command
2. A block explorer's API service like Blockstream.info
3. Any other Bitcoin transaction broadcasting service

## Security Considerations

- Never share your private keys
- Test with minimal amounts before burning significant funds
- Verify all transaction details before broadcasting
- Consider running the code on an air-gapped computer for extra security

## How It Works

1. The script takes a transaction input (UTXO) owned by the provided private key
2. It creates a transaction with an OP_RETURN output (with zero value)
3. Network fees are calculated and subtracted from the input amount
4. The remaining amount is effectively burned as it becomes unspendable

## Customization

You can customize the burn message by modifying the `burnMessage` variable in the `burnBitcoin` function:

```javascript
const burnMessage = Buffer.from('Your custom message here', 'utf8');
```

You can also pass options to the burnBitcoin function to customize the behavior:
```javascript
const options = {
  network: bitcoin.networks.testnet, // Use testnet instead of mainnet
  burnMessage: 'Custom burn message', // Set a custom message
};

burnBitcoin(privateKeyWIF, txId, vout, feeRate, options)
  .then(txHex => console.log('Burn transaction:', txHex))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error:', err));
```
