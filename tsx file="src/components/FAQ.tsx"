              Why would anyone burn Bitcoin?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              People burn Bitcoin for various reasons: to make political statements, to increase scarcity, 
              as a form of "proof of burn" for certain protocols, or as an irreversible donation mechanism.

              What is the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
              The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a proposal by some United States politicians to have the government 
              acquire and hold Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. Proponents claim the government would never sell 
              these Bitcoin, but history shows that political promises regarding monetary policy often change over time.
