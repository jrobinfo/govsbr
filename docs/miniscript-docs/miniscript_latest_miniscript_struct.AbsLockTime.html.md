SummarySource
```
pub struct AbsLockTime(/* private fields */);
```
Expand description
An absolute locktime that implements `Ord`.
## ImplementationsÂ§
SourceÂ§
### impl AbsLockTime
Source
#### pub fn from_consensus(n: u32) -> Result<Self, AbsLockTimeError>
Constructs an `AbsLockTime` from an nLockTime value or the argument to `CHEKCLOCKTIMEVERIFY`.
Source
#### pub fn to_consensus_u32(self) -> u32
Returns the inner `u32` value. This is the value used when creating this `LockTime` i.e., `n OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` or nLockTime.
This calls through to `absolute::LockTime::to_consensus_u32()` and the same usage warnings apply.
Source
#### pub fn is_block_height(&self) -> bool
Whether this is a height-based locktime.
Source
#### pub fn is_block_time(&self) -> bool
Whether this is a time-based locktime.
