## Search Tricks
For a full list of all search features, take a look here.
Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g., `fn:`) to restrict the search to a given item kind.
Accepted kinds are: `fn`, `mod`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `type`, `macro`, and `const`.
Search functions by type signature (e.g., `vec -> usize` or `-> vec` or `String, enum:Cow -> bool`)
You can look for items with an exact name by putting double quotes around your request: `"string"`
Look for functions that accept or return slices and arrays by writing square brackets (e.g., `-> [u8]` or `[] -> Option`)
Look for items inside another one by searching for a path: `vec::Vec`
