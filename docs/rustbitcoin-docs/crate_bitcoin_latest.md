Documentation
Supports (or should support)
  * De/serialization of Bitcoin protocol network messages
  * De/serialization of blocks and transactions
  * Script de/serialization
  * Private keys and address creation, de/serialization and validation (including full BIP32 support)
  * PSBT v0 de/serialization and all but the Input Finalizer role. Use rust-miniscript to finalize.


For JSONRPC interaction with Bitcoin Core, it is recommended to use rust-bitcoincore-rpc.
It is recommended to always use cargo-crev to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.
## Known limitations
### Consensus
This library **must not** be used for consensus code (i.e. fully validating blockchain data). It technically supports doing this, but doing so is very ill-advised because there are many deviations, known and unknown, between this library and the Bitcoin Core reference implementation. In a consensus based cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin it is critical that all parties are using the same rules to validate data, and this library is simply unable to implement the same rules as Core.
Given the complexity of both C++ and Rust, it is unlikely that this will ever be fixed, and there are no plans to do so. Of course, patches to fix specific consensus incompatibilities are welcome.
### Support for 16-bit pointer sizes
16-bit pointer sizes are not supported and we can't promise they will be. If you care about them please let us know, so we can know how large the interest is and possibly decide to support them.
## Documentation
Currently can be found on docs.rs/bitcoin. Patches to add usage examples and to expand on existing docs would be extremely appreciated.
## Contributing
Contributions are generally welcome. If you intend to make larger changes please discuss them in an issue before PRing them to avoid duplicate work and architectural mismatches. If you have any questions or ideas you want to discuss please join us in #bitcoin-rust on libera.chat.
For more information please see `./CONTRIBUTING.md`.
## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This library should always compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.56.1**.
To build with the MSRV you will likely need to pin a bunch of dependencies, see `./contrib/test.sh` for the current list.
## External dependencies
We integrate with a few external libraries, most notably `serde`. These are available via feature flags. To ensure compatibility and MSRV stability we provide two lock files as a means of inspecting compatible versions: `Cargo-minimal.lock` containing minimal versions of dependencies and `Cargo-recent.lock` containing recent versions of dependencies tested in our CI.
We do not provide any guarantees about the content of these lock files outside of "our CI didn't fail with these versions". Specifically, we do not guarantee that the committed hashes are free from malware. It is your responsibility to review them.
## Installing Rust
Rust can be installed using your package manager of choice or rustup.rs. The former way is considered more secure since it typically doesn't involve trust in the CA system. But you should be aware that the version of Rust shipped by your distribution might be out of date. Generally this isn't a problem for `rust-bitcoin` since we support much older versions than the current stable one (see MSRV section).
## Building
The cargo feature `std` is enabled by default. At least one of the features `std` or `no-std` or both must be enabled.
Enabling the `no-std` feature does not disable `std`. To disable the `std` feature you must disable default features. The `no-std` feature only enables additional features required for this crate to be usable without `std`. Both can be enabled without conflict.
The library can be built and tested using `cargo`:
```
git clone git@github.com:rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin.git
cd rust-bitcoin
cargo build

```

You can run tests with:
```
cargo test

```

Please refer to the `cargo` documentation for more detailed instructions.
### Just
We support `just` for running dev workflow commands. Run `just` from your shell to see list available sub-commands.
### Building the docs
We build docs with the nightly toolchain, you may wish to use the following shell alias to check your documentation changes build correctly.
```
alias build-docs='RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly rustdoc --features="$FEATURES" -- -D rustdoc::broken-intra-doc-links'

```

## Testing
Unit and integration tests are available for those interested, along with benchmarks. For project developers, especially new contributors looking for something to work on, we do:
  * Fuzz testing with `Hongfuzz`
  * Mutation testing with `Mutagen`
  * Code verification with `Kani`


There are always more tests to write and more bugs to find, contributions to our testing efforts extremely welcomed. Please consider testing code a first class citizen, we definitely do take PRs improving and cleaning up test code.
### Unit/Integration tests
Run as for any other Rust project `cargo test --all-features`.
### Benchmarks
We use a custom Rust compiler configuration conditional to guard the bench mark code. To run the bench marks use: `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=bench' cargo +nightly bench`.
### Mutation tests
We have started doing mutation testing with mutagen. To run these tests first install the latest dev version with `cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/llogiq/mutagen` then run with `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg=mutate' cargo +nightly mutagen`.
### Code verification
We have started using kani, install with `cargo install --locked kani-verifier` (no need to run `cargo kani setup`). Run the tests with `cargo kani`.
## Pull Requests
Every PR needs at least two reviews to get merged. During the review phase maintainers and contributors are likely to leave comments and request changes. Please try to address them, otherwise your PR might get closed without merging after a longer time of inactivity. If your PR isn't ready for review yet please mark it by prefixing the title with `WIP: `.
### CI Pipeline
The CI pipeline requires approval before being run on each MR.
In order to speed up the review process the CI pipeline can be run locally using act. The `fuzz` and `Cross` jobs will be skipped when using `act` due to caching being unsupported at this time. We do not _actively_ support `act` but will merge PRs fixing `act` issues.
### Githooks
To assist devs in catching errors _before_ running CI we provide some githooks. If you do not already have locally configured githooks you can use the ones in this repository by running, in the root directory of the repository:
```
git config --local core.hooksPath githooks/

```

Alternatively add symlinks in your `.git/hooks` directory to any of the githooks we provide.
## Policy on Altcoins/Altchains
Since the altcoin landscape includes projects which frequently appear and disappear, and are poorly designed anyway we do not support any altcoins. Supporting Bitcoin properly is already difficult enough and we do not want to increase the maintenance burden and decrease API stability by adding support for other coins.
Our code is public domain so by all means fork it and go wild :)
